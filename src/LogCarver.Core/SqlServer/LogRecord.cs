/// LogCarverOffline's LogRecordAdapter/PartitionScanner) populates this
/// with the specific byte offsets - relative to the start of
/// RowLogContents0 itself, directly usable as a position into the bytes
/// RowDecoder.Decode receives - where it detected a physical artifact it
/// can flag but not repair. Deliberately per-offset rather than a single
/// bool: a whole-record flag was tried first and turned out to mark
/// ~94% of a real customer table's events, since most rows are wide
/// enough to have some byte somewhere touch the artifact even when the
/// specific bytes that became a decoded value never did - see
/// research_notes.md and RowDecoder's use of this list to flag only the
/// specific column(s) actually affected.

/// (RowPatcher.ApplyForward), where precise per-column attribution
/// through the splice arithmetic isn't implemented yet - a non-empty
/// list here currently only contributes to a coarser, whole-update note
